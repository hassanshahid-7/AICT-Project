                <h2>Loaded Fries</h2>
                <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong>1 cup shredded cheddar cheese (or cheese of your choice)
                    1/2 cup cooked bacon bits (or crumbled bacon)
                    1/4 cup green onions, chopped

                    skillet over medium heat until crispy. Once done, crumble or chop it into small pieces.
                    Chop the green onions, slice the jalapeños (if using), and dice the tomatoes.Drizzle sour cream over
                    the loaded fries and garnish with chopped cilantro for an added touch of flavor..</p>

                <h2>Creamy Alfredo Pasta</h2>
                <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong> 1 cup heavy cream
                    2 cloves garlic, minced
                    1 1/2 cups freshly grated Parmesan cheese
                    1/2 teaspoon salt (to taste)
                    1/4 teaspoon black pepper (to taste)
                    1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg (optional, but adds depth of flavor)
                    Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish, optional)
                </p>
                <p><strong>Instructions:</strong> In a large skillet or saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.
                    Add the minced garlic and sauté for 1-2 minutes until fragrant, but not browned.
                    Pour in the heavy cream and bring it to a simmer. Stir frequently to prevent the cream from burning.
                    Once simmering, reduce the heat to low and gradually add the grated Parmesan cheese. Stir until the
                    cheese melts completely and the sauce becomes smooth and creamy.
                    Season with salt, pepper, and a pinch of nutmeg (optional) to taste.Add the cooked pasta directly
                    into the Alfredo sauce, tossing gently to coat the noodles with the creamy sauce. If the sauce seems
                    too thick, add a little bit of the reserved pasta water to loosen it up.
                    Stir until the pasta is well coated with the sauce.
