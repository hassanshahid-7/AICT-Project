                    and set it aside.

                    2 tablespoons oil or ghee
                    1 large onion (finely chopped)

                    1/2 cup water or as required for desired consistency
                    1/4 cup fresh cream (optional, for a richer gravy)
                    Fresh coriander leaves (chopped, for garnish)</p>
                <p><strong>Instructions:</strong> Heat oil/ghee: In a deep pan or kadhai, heat 2 tablespoons of oil or
                    ghee on medium heat.

                    Temper spices: Add cumin seeds and bay leaf (if using). Let them splutter.

                    Sauté onions: Add finely chopped onions and sauté until golden brown. This can take about 6-8
                    minutes on medium heat. Stir occasionally to avoid burning.

                    Add ginger-garlic paste: Once the onions are golden, add 1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste and cook
                    for 1-2 minutes until the raw smell disappears.

                    Cook tomatoes: Add the pureed tomatoes to the pan and cook until the oil starts to separate from the
                    masala (about 5-7 minutes). Stir occasionally to ensure it doesn’t stick to the pan.</p>

                <h2>Champey</h2>
                <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong> 500g mutton ribs (or chops)
                    1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste
                    1 teaspoon red chili powder
                    1 teaspoon turmeric powder
                    1 teaspoon garam masala powder
                    1/2 teaspoon cumin powder
                    Salt to taste
                    1/2 cup yogurt</p>
                <p><strong>Instructions:</strong>Pressure Cooker Method: Add 1-2 cups of water (depending on your
                    desired gravy consistency) and cook the mutton under pressure for about 15-20 minutes (or 3-4
                    whistles).
                    Slow-Cook Method: If you're using a regular pot, add water and cook the mutton on low heat for 45-60
                    minutes, stirring occasionally. Keep adding water as needed to maintain the gravy consistency. The
                    meat should become tender and fully cooked by this time.
                    Add optional richness: If you want a richer gravy, grind poppy seeds and melon seeds together to
                    make a smooth paste. Add this paste to the curry in the last 10-15 minutes of cooking for extra
                    creaminess.</p>

                <h2>Kabuli Pulao</h2>
                <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong> 500g mutton (or chicken) (cut into pieces)
                    1 large onion (sliced thinly)
                    1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste
                    1 teaspoon ground cumin
                    1 teaspoon ground coriander
                    1 teaspoon ground turmeric
                    1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
                    2-3 green cardamom pods
                    4-5 cloves
                    1 bay leaf
                    1/2 teaspoon black pepper
                    Salt to taste
                    2 tablespoons oil (vegetable or ghee)
                    2-3 cups water (or chicken stock for extra flavor)</p>
                <p><strong>Instructions:</strong> Heat oil/ghee: In a large pot, heat 2 tablespoons of oil or ghee over
                    medium heat.

                    Sauté onions: Add the sliced onions and sauté until they become golden brown (about 7-8 minutes).

                    Add ginger-garlic paste: Add 1 tablespoon of ginger-garlic paste to the pot and sauté for 1-2
                    minutes until fragrant.

                    Add spices: Add cumin, coriander, turmeric, cinnamon, cardamom pods, cloves, bay leaf, black pepper,
                    and salt. Stir well to coat the onions and meat with the spices.

                    Add meat: Add the mutton (or chicken) pieces and sear them until they are browned on all sides.

                    Add water: Add 2-3 cups of water (or chicken stock) to the pot and bring it to a boil. Then lower
                    the heat, cover the pot, and simmer for about 1 hour for mutton (or 30 minutes for chicken), until
                    the meat is tender and cooked through. If using chicken, the cooking time will be shorter.

                    Set the meat aside: Once the meat is cooked, remove the pieces from the broth and set them aside.
                    Strain the broth, if needed, to remove whole spices.

                    2. Prepare the Rice:
                    Rinse the rice: Wash the basmati rice thoroughly under cold water until the water runs clear. This
                    will remove excess starch.

                    Boil the rice: In a large pot, bring 2 1/2 cups of water to a boil. Add the rice, cinnamon stick,
                    cardamom pods, and cloves. Cook the rice until it is 70-80% cooked (al dente), around 8-10 minutes.
                    Drain the rice and set aside.

                    Fluff the rice: In the same pot, heat 1 tablespoon of ghee or butter. Add the partially cooked rice
                    and gently fluff it up with a fork.
